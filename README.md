# Osutopia
 This projects uses CesiumVR plugin to create and geolocate the Oregon State University. I then modelled Kelly Engineering center and placed infected trees in and around the campus. The user can teleport, run and use locomotion to travel around the campus and interact with trees using the sword. It is an Immersive, Interactive, and fun to play project made in Unreal Engine 5.
